## Route name

This is the path to your new route. You can set your route name by entering in the first input field.

## HTTP Method

The HTTP method of your route. Currently supports `GET`, `PUT`, `POST`, `PATCH` and `DELETE`.

You can use the dropdown under **Http Method** to select which method you like.

## Status Code

This is the status code your route will return.

You can use the dropdown under **Status Code** to select which code you like to return.

## Delay

This will set a delay on your response from the server.

You can use the dropdown under **Delay** to select how much delay you would like in milliseconds.

## Response

This is the response your route will return. You should be able to add any JSON response here.

You can use the text area under **Response** to set what payload you want to return for your route.

## Response Headers

You can add response headers to your route.

Clicking the button `Add Header` will show you two inputs. The first one is the header itself and the second one is the headers value. _(For example, you can put `x-api-key` into the header field with `test` in the value field and the route will return this header)_

## Disable Route

You can disable a route at any time clicking the **Disable Route** checkbox.

## Saving Route

Clicking `Save changes` will save the changes to the configuration file and the server will be updated.

# Features

## Grouping Routes

This was a great idea shared by [JDansercoer](https://github.com/JDansercoer). Which is the ability to group routes based on the route path. This feature is optional and you can enable it in your applications settings.

If you want to know more checkout the docs: [grouped routes documentation](docs/features/grouped-routes)

## Adding Headers to Routes

This was a feature request from [nodesocket](https://github.com/nodesocket). You can now set headers per route through the UI.

# Whats next?

We will be focusing on some more functionality that will hopefully make MockIt more useful.

We are looking into supporting OpenAPI details can be found [here](https://github.com/boyney123/mockit/issues/5)

We are also looking into getting better randomised data into the response fields, more details can be found [here](https://github.com/boyney123/mockit/issues/41)

Also we will be publishing Docker images to the docker registry to get your setup time down, more documentation on how to contribute and also how to deploy MockIt in cloud providers.

If you would like to contribute or have any feature requests or ideas please get involved!
